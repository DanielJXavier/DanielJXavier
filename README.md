## Hey I'm Daniel

With more than 13 years of experience in Front-End web development and expertise in React, TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, and JavaScript, I have consistently delivered elegant solutions to complex problems. My proficiency extends beyond technical skills, as I have successfully led teams on meaningful projects with relevant results.

As an experienced Specialist Front-End Engineer and Tech Lead, I have a proven track record of designing intuitive user interfaces and pixel-perfect designs, ensuring high performance, scalability and security. My leadership style is rooted in collaboration and continuous improvement, driving my teams to achieve excellence and deliver high-quality products.

I'm currently working as a contractor for US companies, helping them design and develop modern, robust, and scalable projects, applying the best practices, actively contributing to the company's goals, and achieving great results together!
