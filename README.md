## Hey I'm Daniel

With a decade-long web development journey and an MBA in strategic people management, I've honed my skills to become a dedicated technical leader.

I aim to craft elegant solutions to intricate problems, leveraging my expertise in JavaScript and its associated frameworks and libraries such as React.js and Node.js, which I have mastered over the years. I also love teaching and helping others, so I led and mentored teams of talented engineers who work on the search and recommendation systems and the design system of the OLX platform, the global leader in online classifieds.

In my past roles, I've acquired and applied pivotal management skills such as emotional intelligence, collaborative design, and agile methodologies. These skills have not only given me a competitive edge but also shaped me into a well-rounded professional. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to learn and a readiness to take on new challenges. I firmly believe in the transformative power of technology and its potential to positively impact society.

Besides technology, I find joy in capturing the beauty of landscapes through my lens and staying active with sports. I am always open to exploring new opportunities and forging meaningful connections. Let's engage in a conversation!
